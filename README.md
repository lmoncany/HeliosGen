# ✨ Why HeliosGen Exists

Most AI generation platforms today lock creators into expensive monthly subscriptions.

You pay every month for credits that:
- expire,
- reset,
- or disappear if unused.

Platforms like Higgsfield, OpenArt, Freepik AI, and others optimize for recurring subscriptions.

**HeliosGen takes the opposite approach.**

---

# 🔓 A Free & Open Source Alternative

HeliosGen is a **free and open source** visual AI workflow builder designed for creators who want:

- Full ownership
- No vendor lock-in
- No forced subscriptions
- No disappearing credits
- Self-hosted freedom

Instead of renting access to a closed platform, you own the entire system.

---

# 💸 Credits That Never Expire

With most AI platforms:

> "Use your credits before the end of the month or lose them."

HeliosGen is different.

You connect your own AI provider accounts (like Kie.ai), meaning:

- Your credits stay on your own account
- Unused credits remain yours
- No monthly reset
- No hidden subscription trap
- No artificial limits imposed by the platform

You only pay for what you actually generate.

---

# 🖥️ Fully Self-Hostable

HeliosGen can run entirely on your own infrastructure.

That means you can:

- Self-host the app
- Control your storage
- Manage your own API keys
- Keep your workflows private
- Customize the platform freely
- Extend it however you want

No dependency on a centralized SaaS.

---

# 🚀 Getting Started

HeliosGen supports two setup modes depending on your needs.

| | Guest Mode | Cloud Mode |
|---|---|---|
| **Setup time** | ~2 minutes | ~20 minutes |
| **Kie.ai API key** | ✅ Required | ✅ Required |
| **ngrok** | ✅ Required | Not needed |
| **Supabase** | ❌ Not needed | ✅ Required |
| **Cloudflare R2** | ❌ Not needed | ✅ Required |
| **Multi-user** | ❌ Single guest user | ✅ Full auth |
| **Persistence** | Local disk + JSON | Cloud DB + CDN |
| **Best for** | Local dev & testing | Production & sharing |

---

## Step 1 — Clone & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SegFault42/HeliosGen
cd HeliosGen
npm install
```

---

## Step 2 — Choose your setup

---

### 🏠 Guest Mode (local, no cloud accounts needed)

**Requirements:** a [Kie.ai](https://kie.ai) API key and [ngrok](https://ngrok.com).

Generated files are saved to `public/generated/` and served as static assets.
History is stored in `data/guest-db.json` and survives server restarts.

**1. Copy the guest environment template**

```bash
cp .env.guest .env.local
```

**2. Fill in your values**

```env
GUEST_MODE=true
KIE_API_KEY=your_kie_api_key_here
CALLBACK_BASE_URL=https://xxxx.ngrok-free.app
```

**3. Start ngrok** (in a separate terminal)

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Copy the `https://xxxx.ngrok-free.app` URL into `CALLBACK_BASE_URL`.

**4. Run the app**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — no login required, gallery persists automatically.

---

### ☁️ Cloud Mode (Supabase + R2, for production or multi-user)

**Requirements:** [Kie.ai](https://kie.ai) API key, [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project, and [Cloudflare R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) bucket.

#### Supabase setup

1. Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to **Settings → API** and copy your Project URL, Anon Key, and Service Role Key
3. Go to **Authentication → Providers → Email** and enable Email Auth
4. Open the **SQL Editor** and run the contents of `supabase-setup.sql`

Tables created:

| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| `spaces` | Workflow canvases (includes `is_public` flag for sharing) |
| `generations` | Image/video generation history |
| `user_uploads` | Uploaded assets |
| `user_settings` | Per-user API keys |
| `asset_cache` | Deduplication cache |

#### Cloudflare R2 setup

1. Create a bucket in the Cloudflare dashboard
2. Enable **Public Access** on the bucket
3. Go to **R2 → Manage R2 API Tokens** and create a token with Object Read & Write
4. Copy your Account ID, Access Key, Secret Key, Bucket Name, and Public CDN URL

#### Environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file:

```env
# Kie.ai
CALLBACK_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com

# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Cloudflare R2
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=your_cloudflare_account_id
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_r2_access_key_id
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_r2_secret_access_key
R2_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
R2_PUBLIC_URL=https://pub-xxxxxxxxxxxx.r2.dev

# Azure OpenAI (optional — for GPT Image 2 and similar models)
AZURE_API_KEY=your_azure_api_key
```

#### Local development with ngrok

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Set `CALLBACK_BASE_URL` to your ngrok URL during local dev.

#### Run the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

Users sign in with email/password, enter their own Kie.ai API key in Settings, and generations are stored in Supabase + R2.

---

# 🌍 Deployment (Cloud Mode)

HeliosGen can be deployed anywhere that supports Node.js.

## Recommended: Vercel

1. Import the repository into Vercel
2. Add all environment variables from your `.env.local`
3. Set `CALLBACK_BASE_URL=https://your-vercel-domain.vercel.app`
4. Deploy

## Other platforms

- Railway
